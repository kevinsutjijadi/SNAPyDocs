# Spatial Graph Analysis in Cython

SGACy is a specially developed library to perform efficient pathfinding and other related functions on a spatial graph using Cython. This level of optimization enables for Urban Network Analysis (UNA) in the scale of cities on an acceptable time/processing cost. Comparison tests with networkx results in 20-100x times faster for single pathfinding, and up to 3 to 4 magnitudes on alternative-pathfinding, which are crucial for detour ratios on some UNA's toolset.
