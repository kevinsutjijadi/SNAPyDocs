## GraphSims   <i> class </i>
`#!python GraphSims(NetworkDf:GeoDataFrame, EntriesDf:GeoDataFrame, **kwargs)`

:   The core process for spatial network analysis is operated/structured within the `#!python Graphsims` Class, which reads Geopandas Geodataframe for entries and network data. The class initialization prepackages and compiles further processing and its subsequent results. main class for network analysis processing, initialization stage will have some heavy processes included. the processes in order

    - adding Feature-ID of network and entrances as attribute if not found
    - building networkx graph using BuildGraph from prcs_grph
    - building entries data, appending with entrance/relation to graph related information.

        !!! info "entries data dumping feature"
            Since processing into the graph relation can take some time, there is the feature that saves and reads dump data from previous run through. The settings of this feature will be explained later at kwargs parameter.
    
    - appending point coordinate as attributes unto EntriesDf



    ##### Parameters

    :   <b>NetworkDf</b> : GeoDataFrame
        :   Geopandas geodataframe of network data, containing edges in lines/polylines data form. Can contain weight multiplier for costs and also vertex classification, with the default 

    :   <b>EntriesDf</b> : GeoDataFrame
        :   Geopandas geodataframe of Entries data, containing nodes in lines/polylines data form. Can contain weight

    :   <b>**kwargs</b> : Dict/keys-values
        :   Parameter arguments, that contain:

            - `#!python "EntDist" float `   default 100.0

                search distance to closest edge of network, further distanced entrances will not be accounted
            
            - `#!python "EntID" string `   default "FID"

                string of attribute/column name for Entrance Feature ID. If not found, will be automatically made in initialization process

            - `#!python "EdgeID" string `   default "FID"

                string of attribute/column name for Network Feature ID. If not found, will be automatically made in initialization process
            
            - `#!python "EdgeCost" string `   default None

                string of attribute/column name for Network cost multiplier, if None, all edges will use the value of "EdgeCostDef" argument
            
            - `#!python "EdgeCostDef" string `   default 1.0

                default value for edge cost, will only be applied if "EdgeCost" is None

            - `#!python "EntryDtDump" bool `   default True

                Switch to use entries data initialization results dumping. If true, then it will search for a pre-existing data dump, or if not found will make one at "Directory" argument location.

            - `#!python "EntryDtDumpOvr" bool `   default False

                Switch to overide pre-existing entries data dump. Only works if "EntryDtDump" is True. If there are updates on network or entries data, this argument is used.

### GraphSims <i>Items</i>

:   #### .baseSet <i> dict </i>

    :   Dictionary of settings

    :   contains a nested tuple of each point with information of the matching EntriesDf poin with the graph. Tuple structure of each point contains:
        
        - EntryDf point ID
        - connected line/edge ID
        - distance from entry point to intersection
        - tuple of distance to the start and end nodes
        - point of intersection
        - tuple of connected network node ids
        - weight of edge
        - tuple of spliited shapely point

:   #### .Gph <i> Graph </i>

        <i>GraphSims.EntriesDf with the specified results column</i>

        Function for betweeness patronage, calculating segment traffic weighting from origin capacity, distributed through weightable destinations within the network in a set distance. Further elaboration on the method can be accessed on method documentation.

        !!! info "result return"
